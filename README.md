## Project Overview

The project aims to synthesize a synthetic piano using a limited number of parameters. The audio samples of individual
piano tones are provided in a WAV file, which will be analyzed to generate a musical composition based on a given MIDI
file.

## Project Structure

The project is structured into the following main sections:

1. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Loading the audio samples and preprocessing the data.
2. **Fundamental Frequency Analysis**: Estimating the fundamental frequency of the piano tones.
3. **Fundamental Frequency Refinement**: Refining the fundamental frequency estimation using the Discrete Time Fourier
   Transform (DTFT).
