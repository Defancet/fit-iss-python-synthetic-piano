# Signals and Systems project - Synthetic piano :musical_keyboard:

In the project, your task will be to create as faithful a synthetic piano as possible, whose sound characteristics will be compressed into only a few parameters. You have recordings of individual tones at your disposal, which will need to be analyzed and then you will generate a song based on the supplied file.

In the file *klavir.wav* you have available a wav file with all the notes of the piano1. The sampling frequency is *Fs* = 48 kHz and the recording has one channel. The notes are from C2 (MIDI 24) to C9 (MIDI 108), so there are 85 in total, each note is 2 seconds long. You can find an overview of MIDI markings and tone frequencies at *midi.txt*. In addition, in *xlogin00.txt * you have the MIDI marking of the tones on which you will demonstrate the continuous solution of the project.
